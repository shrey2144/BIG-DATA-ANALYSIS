Big Data Analysis with PySpark
This project demonstrates how to perform scalable data analysis on large datasets using Apache PySpark. It is developed as part of a virtual internship task from CodTech.


Project Overview:
The main objective of this notebook is to analyze large datasets using distributed computing tools. PySpark is used to demonstrate the power of big data tools for real-world data processing and insights.


Tools & Technologies:
-  Apache Spark(via PySpark)
-  Python 3
-  Pandas
-  Matplotlib & Seaborn (for optional visualization)
-  Google Colab(for cloud-based development)



Key Features:
- Data loading and schema inference with PySpark
- Handling of large data that wouldn't fit into memory using Pandas
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on distributed data
- Data Cleaning & Transformation at scale
- Performance comparison between Pandas and PySpark (if applicable)
- Visualizations to support insights


File Structure:
BIG_DATA__ANALYSIS.ipynb  --> Jupyter notebook with full analysis
README.md                 --> You're reading it now!


How to Run the Project:
You can run this notebook in Google Colab (recommended) or any local environment with PySpark installed.


To run in Google Colab:
Open Google Colab
Upload the notebook file (BIG_DATA__ANALYSIS.ipynb)
Add the following at the top of the notebook to install PySpark:
!pip install pyspark


Sample Analysis:
* How distributed DataFrames work in PySpark
* How to process large CSV or JSON files efficiently
* How to use Spark SQL for queries
* How to apply grouping, filtering, and aggregation on massive data
* How PySpark outperforms traditional tools for large-scale data


Learning Outcome:
* By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience with:
* Big Data processing fundamentals
* Writing efficient Spark code in Python
* Conducting end-to-end data analysis on a scalable platform
